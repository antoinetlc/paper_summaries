### Problem 

* The paper tackles the problem of image translation, i.e mapping an image to another image automatically without user intervention. Such problem often arises in computer graphics and vision. An example could be mapping a sketch to a drawing or changing a satellite image to a map.

### Novelty and contributions :

* Provide a general framework for image to image translation using conditonal generative adversarial networks (cGAN) that produces sharp results and works on a large variety of problems.

* Study the influence of the different architectures of the discriminator and generator and compare how changing the loss function affect the results.
